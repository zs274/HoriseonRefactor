# Horiseon Refactor

For this assignment, we were tasked with refactoring a website so that it fits accessibility standards and follows a number of other criteria. 

To do this I made sure that semantic HTML elements were used and that they followed a logical structure. I also added alt text to all images on the page so that screen readers can easily describe the image for anyone who may have difficulty seeing the images. I also condensed the CSS elements to reduce the number of lines of code used thus making it easier for other developers to view the code and see what is being styled. 

The easiest part of this project was condensing the CSS elements and the part I struggled with the most was actually reading through all the lines of code and making sure everything was correct and logical.
